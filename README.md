 # In this assignment, Our job will be to create our own version of the Vecta Corp. website built using Bootstrap. We will incorporate features that we learned about in this module in conjunction with some components to create an aesthetically pleasing and usable version of the Vecta Corp. site that relies entirely on Bootstrap. 
 
 # 1. Make sure that Bootstrap is included in your project. This includes all necessary CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. All necessary files are in their proper folders and the HTML documents are in the root of the project. 

 # 2. Within the index.html page you will have a navigation menu, a header, some content, and a footer. Make sure the content area is divided up into 3 even columns.

 # 3.Create a navigation bar that is free floating and in the upper/middle of the page. It should not be fixed or static as is outlined within the examples for Bootstrap. Look at the screenshot below for examples of what I’m looking for. Add the navigation menu items Home, About Us, Solutions, Support, and Contact Us. About Us should be a drop down menu that includes Overview, Company History, Management, and Careers. Solutions should be a drop down menu that includes vProspect, vConvert, and vRetain. 

 # 4.Use the Carousel component to add a carousel of rotating images to the main page of the site. The carousel should appear below the navigation bar, should span a width of 100%, and should include appropriate software-based images that have been included for you in the images folder. Come up with a catchy call to action and associated text that matches each image in the carousel. Use the primary default-sized button to add a More Info button under the text. 

 # 5. Use the Tabs component to divide up your 3 product descriptions and their associated content within the main page. This should appear in the Content section within the center column (col 2). Additionally, add some Welcome text to the Content section within the left-most column (col 1). Add some footer text along with a horizontal rule to the footer section of the site.

 # 6.Create 2 client testimonials within the Content section (col 3). Use links or buttons to display the person’s name only. When the user clicks the name, display their testimonial. Use the Collapse component to make this work.
 
 # 7.Create a new web page for Solutions. Add a second navigation menu to the right of the web page that includes the items in the main drop down menu including vProspect, vConvert, and vRetain. Add the content to the web page on the left which is included in the Assets folder. Use Scrollspy on the navigation menu so that the user can see the item in the navigation menu highlighted as they scroll down the page.
